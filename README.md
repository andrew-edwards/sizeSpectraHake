The goal of sizeSpectraHake is to analyse the hake length data. Wonâ€™t
work for others as data not included in package.

## Installation

    install.packages("remotes")    # If you do not already have the "remotes" package

    remotes::install_github("andrew-edwards/sizeSpectraHake")

If you get an error like

    Error in utils::download.file(....)

then the connection may be timing out (happens to us on the DFO
network). Try

    options(timeout = 1200)

and then try and install again.
